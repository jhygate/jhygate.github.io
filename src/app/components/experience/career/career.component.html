  <p>
    I'm currently working at UJ an exciting insurtech startup, working to bring fairness and
    transparency and ease of use to the insurance industry.<br /><br />
    I work in small, agile, cross-functional teams where I help plan new features, scope
    functionality with the key stakeholders and implement them!<br />
    I'm there from resourcing all the way up to code-review, final product testing, live feature
    monitoring and urgent fixes (not that we ever need any of those...)<br /><br />
    I'm working mostly with Python in the backend and tooling, and Angular for the frontend as well
    as dabbling in platform work with AWS, Kubernetes, Docker and Gitlab CI/CD.<br /><br />
    My favourite project has been working with the Data Science team to refactor and rebuild their
    ML pricing pipeline.<br />
    I helped optimise it from a multi-day process to a 2-hour process, with increased visibility,
    error handling, testing and ease of use with Dagster, MlFlow (brand new technologies for the
    company) and platform work.
